<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Resolute allows users to define a set of claim functions and associate them 
with an AADL model. You can use these claim functions to represent the 
requirements to be satisfied, the verification actions used to verify them, and 
assumptions made by a verification action in order to produce a valid result. 
You will express the requirements as predicates on subrequirements and 
verification actions. Verification actions invoke Boolean computational 
functions to represent predicates to be evaluated and general computational 
functions to compute values to be compared in predicates. The computational 
function notation has its roots in Lute and REAL. You can organize claim 
functions into a hierarchy where a claim function is satisfied only if its 
subclaim functions are satisfied according to the specified predicate logic.</p>

<p>Throughout this document, we use an example of resource budget analysis, in 
particular, an analysis of weight. The full example is available on the <a 
href="https://github.com/osate/examples/tree/master/core-examples/resolute">
OSATE pages at GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>With the Resolute tool, users define claim functions and computational 
functions in Resolute annex libraries, i.e., Resolute annex clauses placed 
directly in an AADL package. The example below shows a claim function called 
SCSReq1 that represents a requirement and consists of two verification actions. 
At least one of them must be satisfied for the requirement to be satisfied 
(expressed by <strong>or</strong>). The example also shows a computational 
function that calculates the sum of budgets of all direct subcomponents. 
Finally, the example shows a global constant definition that a user can 
reference in a Resolute library or Resolute subclause. Here, we use it to 
specify the maximum weight, against which the verification actions will compare 
the total.</p>

<p><img src="images/image1.png" style="height:12em" /></p>

<p>Users then associate the claim functions representing requirements with 
component types or implementations by <strong>prove</strong> statements declared 
in Resolute annex subclauses. The example shows the <strong>prove</strong> 
statement for SCSReq1 with the component itself passed in as a parameter.</p>

<p><img src="images/image2.png" style="height:7em" /></p>

<p>Users invoke the <em>Resolute</em> command on a component implementation. 
This results in an instantiation of the component implementation and the 
application of all claim functions associated with all of the components in the 
instance model via the <strong>prove</strong> statements.</p>

<p><img src="images/image3.png" style="height:19em" /></p>

<p>The verification results are then displayed in a view labeled <em>Assurance 
Case.</em> For each claim function invoked by a <strong>prove</strong> 
statement, Resolute evaluates any claim function called by the claim function 
expression.</p>

<p>Currently, each <strong>prove</strong> statement is shown at the top level of 
the Assurance Case view. This is the case for different <strong>prove</strong> 
statements of the top-level component as well as any subcomponent that has 
<strong>prove</strong> statements.</p>

<h1 id="claim-functions">Claim Functions</h1>

<p>Claim functions can represent requirements, verification actions, and 
assumptions. There is currently no syntactic distinction in their use. This 
section describes conventions that users should follow to distinguish the 
different uses.</p>

<p>Claim functions have a name, zero or more parameters, a description, and a 
predicate expression. The claim function has a return type of Boolean (true to 
represent success and false to represent failure). The syntax of a claim 
function is as follows:</p>

<pre>
Claim_Function ::=

name <strong>(</strong> ( parameter ( , parameter )* )? <strong>) &lt;=</strong>

<strong>**</strong> description <strong>**</strong> claim_function_expression

parameter ::= name <strong>:</strong> type

description ::= "text" ( parameter_reference | "text" )*
</pre>

<p>Parameters typically represent the model elements to which the claim function 
applies and values used in the predicate expression to determine whether the 
predicate is satisfied. The parameter declaration consists of a name and a type 
(for more information, see the Resolute Type System section in the <em>Resolute 
Language Reference</em>).</p>

<p>The description can be a combination of strings and parameter references; it 
explains the role of the claim function and is displayed as part of the result 
in the Assurance Case view. The description for a claim function consists of a 
sequence of strings and references to claim function parameters, global 
constants, or local constants (defined by <strong>let</strong> statements). If 
the values are numerical with a unit, you can specify the unit to be used for 
display by indicating the desired unit after a <strong>%</strong>, e.g., 
WeightLimit%kg. The units are those defined by Units property types in AADL 
property sets and do not have to be qualified by the Units type.</p>

<p>The evaluation of the predicate determines the success (true return value) or 
failure (false return value) of the claim function. The claim function 
expression is assumed to be a logical expression (<strong>and</strong>, 
<strong>forall</strong>, <strong>or</strong>, <strong>exists</strong>, 
<strong>andthen</strong>) to represent a predicate. In the case of 
<strong>and</strong> and <strong>forall</strong>, all expression elements are 
executed and then the result is evaluated and returns true only if all claim 
functions return true. Executing all claim functions allows Resolute to inform 
the user of all failing claim functions rather than one at a time by not 
executing the remaining elements in the <strong>and</strong> or 
<strong>forall</strong> expression. The <strong>andthen</strong> operator allows 
users to specify that the right-hand claim function should only be executed if 
the left-hand claim function returns true.</p>

<h2 id="resolute-libraries-of-claim-functions">Resolute Libraries of Claim 
Functions</h2>

<p>Users define claim functions in Resolute annex libraries. Declare a Resolute 
annex library directly in a package through the <strong>annex</strong> Resolute 
<strong>{**</strong> &lt;library content&gt; <strong>**};</strong> statement. 
You can place this statement in a package by itself, combine it with library 
declarations for other annexes, or combine it with classifier declarations in 
the same package. A package cannot contain multiple Resolute annex library 
declarations; each library must be placed in a separate package.</p>

<p>Note: Resolute assumes a global name space for the names of claim functions 
and computational functions. Therefore, their names must be globally unique. You 
can reference them in <strong>prove</strong> statements, other claim functions, 
or computational functions without qualification by a package name.</p>

<h2 id="application-of-claim-functions">Application of Claim Functions</h2>

<p>Invoke a claim function on a component by specifying a <strong>prove</strong> 
statement in a Resolute annex subclause of the component implementation. The 
Resolute subclause of a component implementation can contain multiple 
<strong>prove</strong> statements. This claim function is then executed on every 
instance of this component implementation when the <em>Resolute</em> command is 
invoked.</p>

<p>When you have a system with subsystems, you can associate claim functions 
with each component implementation in the system hierarchy. The verification of 
this claim will then be performed for each instance of the component 
implementations with a <strong>prove</strong> statement. Typically, you have 
<strong>prove</strong> statements for the top-level system that involve 
verifying the system across multiple layers, e.g., performing resource budget 
analysis across the whole system. You may also perform compositional 
verification by verifying a component with respect to its direct subcomponents. 
In this case, you place a <strong>prove</strong> statement at each layer, i.e., 
with each component implementation of components involved in the system. We 
illustrate this capability with our resource budget analysis, by analyzing 
budgets of direct subcomponents against the specified budget limit for each 
layer of the architecture.</p>

<p>Note: A <strong>prove</strong> statement cannot be declared for a component 
type. A declaration with the component type would mean that it applies to all 
instances of all implementations.</p>

<p>The parameter values can be integers, real numbers, strings, Boolean 
literals, model elements, references to global constants, and collections of 
these types. They must match the specified type for the parameter.</p>

<p>One special model element reference is expressed by the keyword 
<strong>this</strong>. It refers to the instance model object of the model 
element that contains the <strong>prove</strong> statement. The keyword 
<strong>this</strong> can only be used in the <strong>prove</strong> 
statement—not in verification action expressions. This constraint means that 
<strong>this</strong> must be passed to a claim function for it to know what 
model element it operates on—unless you have a global claim function (see Global 
Constants).</p>

<pre><strong>prove (</strong> Memory_safe <strong>( this ))</strong></pre>

<p>You can also identify a subcomponent of <strong>this</strong>; i.e., 
associate the verification action with a component down a path of the 
architecture hierarchy. This allows you to specify a verification action for a 
specific component instance. This example shows how a <strong>prove</strong> 
statement is applied to a subcomponent called subsystem1:</p>

<pre><strong>prove (</strong> Fully_Connected <strong>( this.</strong>subsystem1 <strong>))</strong></pre>

<p>The <strong>prove</strong> statement can be associated with the component 
classifier of the subcomponent. In this case, it applies to all instances of 
that component. We recommend that you associate <strong>prove</strong> 
statements with a path only if the <strong>prove</strong> is intended for that 
particular instance of a subcomponent.</p>

<h2 id="uses-of-claim-functions">Uses of Claim Functions</h2>

<p>The compiler does enforce that claim functions can be invoked only in 
<strong>prove</strong> statements, and as operands in <strong>and</strong>, 
<strong>or</strong>, <strong>andthen</strong>, <strong>exists</strong>, and 
<strong>forall</strong> operations, and cannot be invoked in computational 
functions.</p>

<h3 id="claim-functions-as-requirements-to-be-satisfied">Claim Functions as 
Requirements to Be Satisfied</h3>

<p>Users can represent a requirement with a claim function and associated it 
with an implementation of a system using the <strong>prove</strong> statement, 
as shown in this example for a system called <em>SCS</em>.</p>

<pre><strong>prove</strong> <strong>(</strong>SCSReq1<strong>(this))</strong></pre>

<p>The description of the claim function representing the requirement may 
include a requirement identifier as part of the text, as shown in the next 
example.</p>

<p>Global constants specify values in requirements that users tend to change. 
This allows you to localize the change to a single location. In our example, we 
reference a Resolute global constant <em>MaximumWeight</em> to indicate the 
desired limit in the descriptive text, as parameters to other claim functions 
and computational functions, and in predicate expressions.</p>

<p>The expression specifies the verification actions whose results are used as 
evidence that the requirement has been met. In the example below, we show a 
verification action that assures the subcomponent weight budget totals are 
within the limit and a verification action that recursively adds the actual 
weights.</p>

<p>The first verification action illustrates compositional verification of 
weights in terms of the budgets at the next lower level, while the second always 
takes into account all actuals. Note that the first analysis is not affected by 
a lower level change as long as the budget of its enclosing component is not 
exceeded, while the second analysis is affected by every change in weights 
throughout the whole system.</p>

<p><img src="images/image5.png" style="height:8em" /></p>

<p>Because we have already specified the weight limit as a property in the AADL 
model, we can reference it to be supplied as a value to the verification action, 
as shown below.</p>

<pre>SCSReq1AssureSubcomponentTotal<strong>(</strong>self, <strong>property(</strong>self, SEI::WeightLimit<strong>))</strong></pre>

<p>In addition, we can add a verification action to verify that the property and 
the global constant have the same value.</p>

<pre>SCSReq1AssureWeightLimitProperty<strong>(</strong>self, <strong>property(</strong>self, SEI::WeightLimit<strong>)</strong>, MaximumWeight<strong>)</strong></pre>

<p>A requirement may be specified vaguely such that it cannot be verified. In 
this case, you may need to refine the requirement into subrequirements that are 
verifiable. Do this by listing claim functions representing the subclaims in the 
claim function expression of the original requirement.</p>

<p>The claim function expression in a "requirement" claim function may contain 
<strong>and</strong>, <strong>forall</strong>, <strong>andthen</strong>, 
<strong>or</strong>, or <strong>exists</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>and</strong> and <strong>forall</strong> expressions indicate 
that all operands are evaluated; the claim is then true if all operands return 
<strong>true</strong>. This means that all claim functions or Boolean 
computational functions are executed independently of whether they return true 
or false. Once all have been executed, the expression returns 
<strong>true</strong> only if all operands are <strong>true</strong>. This 
allows Resolute to report to the user all failing operands rather than aborting 
after the first failing one and requiring the user to correct it before finding 
out that others fail as well.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>or</strong> and <strong>exists</strong> indicate alternative 
sets of verification actions. The operands are executed and the results are 
evaluated in order; the first returning <strong>true</strong> determines true 
for the claim. Effectively the user specifies that the right-hand operand is 
executed only if the left-hand operand fails. This allows you to specify an 
alternative way of verifying a claim if one verification action is not 
successful. You can also use it to specify a <strong>fail</strong> statement as 
the right-hand operand to provide a special message for a failing left-hand 
operand.</p></li>

<li><p>The <strong>andthen</strong> expression executes the left-hand operand 
first. If it fails, the whole expression is considered as failing (returns 
<strong>false</strong>). If the left returns <strong>true</strong>, the 
right-hand side is executed and its result value becomes the value of the 
<strong>andthen</strong> expression. This allows users to specify that certain 
claim functions, such as verification actions, should be executed only if 
preceding verification actions pass.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Resolute allows computational expressions to be mixed with subclaim 
functions in a claim function expression. Unfortunately, the results of their 
evaluation are not shown in the Assurance Case view. This leads to the scenario 
where all subclaims are shown as satisfied (<strong>true</strong>), but the 
claim itself is shown as failed because the computational constraint expression 
evaluates to <strong>false</strong>. Therefore, we recommend that users not mix 
subclaims and computational expressions.</p>

<h3 id="claim-functions-as-verification-actions">Claim Functions as Verification 
Actions</h3>

<p>Claim functions also represent verification actions, whose execution produces 
a verification result as evidence. You can associate verification actions with a 
requirement by calling them in the claim function expression of the claim 
function representing the requirement, as shown earlier.</p>

<p>For a claim function that represents a verification action, the expression 
represents the predicate to be evaluated in order for the verification action to 
pass. One of the elements of the predicate typically is a constraint value to be 
met, and the other is a computational function call or reference to a 
computational result to compare. In the next example, the verification action 
computes the sum of the subcomponent budgets and compares them to the maximum. 
<em>AddSubcomponentWeightBudgets</em> is a computational function that returns a 
<strong>real</strong> value.</p>

<p>Note: The identifier <em>VA1</em> is added into the description text by 
convention.</p>

<p>If we want to produce a special error message for a failing verification 
condition, we can use the <strong>or</strong> operation with a 
<strong>fail</strong> statement as the right-hand side. Failure of the left-hand 
side results in the execution of the right-hand side; i.e., this operation 
effectively throws a fail exception with the specified description text, which 
is then associated with the enclosing claim function.</p>

<p><img src="images/image6.png" style="height:5em" /></p>

<h3 id="verification-assumptions-and-preconditions">Verification Assumptions and 
Preconditions</h3>

<p>Verification actions may make</p>
<ul>
<li><p>assumptions that must hold for the verification action result to be 
accurate</p></li>
<li><p>preconditions that must hold in order for the verification action to be 
executed</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A use case for a verification action assumption is that the calculation of 
the weight totals can be performed even though some components may not yet have 
a weight budget. However, it is still useful to evaluate the partial weight 
total result as it may already be close to or exceed the limit. This allows 
Resolute to inform the user without first requiring the user to complete the 
model with missing weight budget properties. The <strong>assumption</strong> 
function will determine how many components have a weight budget and report the 
percentage of components with a weight budget.</p>

<p>The following example illustrates a verification action with an assumption. 
We have a claim function that models the assumption to be evaluated, called 
<em>SCSReq1SubcomponentsHaveWeight</em>. It counts the number of components and 
those with a <em>GrossWeight</em> property and generates a fail message with the 
percentage of components with a weight property.</p>

<p>We then use this claim function in a new claim function that executes both 
the assumption claim function and the claim function representing the actual 
verification by adding the subcomponent weight budgets that we defined earlier 
(<em>SCSReq1VA1VerifySubcomponentTotals</em>). The <strong>and</strong> operator 
allows both assumption and verification action claim functions to be 
evaluated.</p>

<p><img src="images/image7.png" style="height:4.5em" /></p>

<p><img src="images/image8.png" style="height:5.5em" /></p>

<p>A use case for a verification action precondition is that the verification 
action cannot perform the analysis until all the data is present; i.e., all 
components involved in the computation have appropriate property values. In this 
case, we use the <strong>andthen</strong> operator instead of 
<strong>and</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="global-claim-functions">Global Claim Functions</h2>

<p>Claim functions can be defined without parameter. In this case, the claim 
function first queries the instance model for objects and then applies a claim 
function to each element of the query. The query is accomplished by identifying 
a collection of model elements and then applying a claim function to each 
element of the collection using <strong>forall</strong> or 
<strong>exists</strong>. Model element collections can be identified by 
category, e.g., by <strong>threads</strong> for all threads in the instance 
model or by set constructors such as <strong>instances</strong>(classifier), 
which returns all component instances of the specified classifier. Collections 
and their operations are discussed in detail in the <em>Resolute Language 
Reference</em>.</p>

<p>The example shows a global constraint that all threads must have a period 
property value.</p>

<p><img src="images/image9.png" style="height:5.5em" /></p>

<p>You can include global claim functions as <strong>prove</strong> statements 
on any model element, since they query the whole model independently of a 
specific model element. However, you should place them in the top-level 
component implementation to which the <em>Resolute</em> command is applied; 
otherwise, they may be invoked multiple times.</p>
