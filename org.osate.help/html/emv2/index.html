<h2>Error-Model Annex v2</h2>
<p>
Introduction
</p>
<p>
The support of the Error-Model Annex is done by several means:index.html
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
   		<strong><a href="fha.html">Functional Hazard Assessment</a></strong> support
   		for producing reliability report of your architecture.
   </li>
   <li>
   		<strong><a href="fault-impact.html">Fault Impact</a></strong> traces
   		the error path from error sources to the final component impact by the fault.
   </li>
   <li>
   		<strong><a href="unhandled-faults.html">Unhandled faults</a></strong> report
   		traces and logs potential modeling problems related to the error description 
   		of the system architecture.
   </li>
   <li>
   		<strong><a href="consistency.html">Consistency Checks</a></strong> reports
   		any discrepancy and inconsistency between the different error notations
   		(component error model, composite error model, etc.).
   </li>        
   <li>
   		<strong><a href="https://github.com/cmu-sei/emfta/blob/develop/doc/white-paper.md">Fault-Tree Analysis</a></strong> support
   		for fault tree analysis from the AADL model. This is a tutorial illustrating its use through multiple steps in the development process.
   		See also an <a href="https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2016/07/emfta-an-open-source-tool-for-fault-tree-analysis.html">SEI Blog post</a> on the graphical EMFTA editor.
   </li>
   <li>
   		<strong><a href="imv.html">Instance Model Viewer</a></strong> support
   		for viewing error and their propagations in the underlying architecture.
   </li>
   <li>
   		<strong><a href="rbd.html">Reliability Block Diagram</a></strong>: provides
   		metrics about the overall reliability of the system, based on a gross
   		estimation.
   	</li>
</ul>
<p>
These functionalities are available in the Fault Analysis menu from OSATE, as shown in the
following picture. Note that most of functions apply to the instance model. To use
them, you will need to select the system instance and run the expected analysis.
