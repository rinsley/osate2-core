<h2>Error-Model Annex v2 -Functional Hazard Assessment Analysis - FHA</h2>
<p>
A technique known as Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA) - not to be 
confused with Fault Hazard Analysis (see FAA System Safety Handbook) - 
is defined as part of SAE ARP4761. It is a systematic examination of 
systems and subsystem functions to identify and classify failure 
conditions of those functions according to their severity.
</p>

<p>
We support this process by working with specifications of the system 
or subsystems of interest expressed as component type descriptions 
for all component categories in AADL ranging from system and process 
to processor and device. We will than attach information relevant 
to an FHA through EMV2 subclauses and property associations.
</p>

<p>
We use the EMV2 subclause to declare for each component the relevant 
outgoing error propagations and identify those outgoing error 
propagations that are error sources. In the error source declaration 
we may identify the error source as an error state or as an error 
type set (set of type tokens). Those are the entities that represent 
potential hazards to other components or the environment.
</p>

EMV2 includes a set of properties that are defined in the property set EMV2. 
Three such properties are :
</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Severity</strong></li>
<li><strong>Likelihood</strong></li>
<li><strong>Hazard</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>They allow modelers to provide descriptive hazard in-formation to the model. 
The property values are associated with error sources or outgoing error 
propagations of components. They are declared in the properties section of EMV2 
subclauses. They can be declared for component types or implementations; in 
this case they apply to all in-stances of components of this type. 
Or they can be declared for specific subcomponents; in this case the hazard
 description can be specific to the context of the subcomponent (component instance).
</p>
<p>
The path in the applies to clause of the property association is used to 
identify the specific target of the hazard description. 
The path is a <dot> (.) separated list of identifiers. 
The path may start with zero or more subcomponent identifiers 
starting with a subcomponent in the component whose error annex 
subclause contains the property association. 
The path is followed by a error propagation identifier or error source identifier and 
optionally an error type identifier. The error propagation or error source must 
be of the last subcomponent in the path or the component classifier 
(type or implementation) that contains the error annex subclause.
</p>

<p>
The Error Model V2 Annex standard defines severity and Likelihood as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Severity</strong>: integer value to indicate the severity level 
of the hazard ranging from 1 (high) to 5 (low). MIL-STD 882D suggests 
descriptive labels (Catastrophic, Critical, Marginal, Negligible). 
ARP 4761 defines descriptive labels (Catastrophic, Hazardous, Major, Minor, NoEffect). 
</li>
<li>
<strong>Likelihood</strong>: enumeration value that indicates the likelihood 
with which the hazard occurs. Likelihood is expressed in terms of levels 
ranging from A (high) to E (low). Each level typically has an associated 
probability of occurrence (p) threshold. MIL-STD 882D suggests likelihood 
levels (Frequent: p>10e-1, Probable: 10e-1>p>10e-2, 
Occasional: 10e-2>p>10e-3, Remote: 10e-3>p>10e-6, Improbable: p<10e-6) 
for probability of occurrence over the life of an item. 
In the context of ARP 4761 or DO178 defines descriptive labels 
(Probable: p>10e-5, Remote: 10e-5>p>10e-7, ExtremelyRemote: 
10e-7<p>10e-9, ExtremelyImprobable: p<10e-9) for probability of 
occurrence per operational hour.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Severity and Likelihood from the standard EMV2 are the following:
</p>
<pre>

Severity : inherit aadlinteger applies to (all);

Likelihood : inherit enumeration (A, B, C, D, E) applies to (all);

</pre>

<p>
MIL-STD-882 and ARP 4761 define separate sets of labels for 
different severity and criticality levels. 
We make those available through two separate property, as shown below.
</p>
<p>
The Severity and Likelihood for MIL-STD-882 are the following:
</p>
<pre>
property set MILSTD882
  is

Severity : inherit enumeration (Catastrophic, Critical, Marginal, Negligible) applies to (all);
Likelihood : inherit enumeration (Frequent, Probable, Occasional, Remote, Improbable) applies to (all);

end MILSTD882;
</pre>

<p>
The Severity and Likelihood for ARP 4761 are the following:
</p>
<pre>
property set ARP4761
  is
  
Severity : inherit enumeration (Catastrophic, Hazardous, Major, Minor, NoEffect) applies to (all);
Likelihood : inherit enumeration (Probable, Remote, ExtremelyRemote, ExtremelyImprobable) applies to (all);

end ARP4761;
</pre>

<p>
The Hazard property is defined in the property set 
EMV2 and consists of the following record fields:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crossreference</strong>: string value for a cross reference into an external document. </li>
<li><strong>Phase</strong>: string value to identify the operational phase (mode) in which the hazard is relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Environment</strong>: string value to describe the operational environment in which the hazard is relevant.</li>
<li><strong>Description</strong>: string value providing a textual description of the hazard.</li>
<li><strong>Verificationmethod</strong>: string value to textually describe the verification method used to address the hazard.</li>
<li><strong>Risk</strong>: string value to textually describe the potential risk of the hazard.</li>
<li><strong>Comment</strong>: string value to textually describe additional comments about the hazard.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Processed modeling patterns</h3>
<p>
The following modeling patterns are considered when
generating the FHA:
</p>
<ul>
<li>ErrorEvent referenced/used in an Error State Machine</li>
<li>ErrorSource specified in the error propagations sections</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each processed artifact must have the following properties attached:
</p>
<ul>
<li>EMV2::Severity or ARP4761::Severity or MILSTD882::Severity</li>
<li>EMV2::Likelihood or ARP4761::Likelihood or MILSTD882::Likelihood</li>
<li>EMV2::Hazard</li>
</ul>


<h3>Example model</h3>
<p>
The following model illustrates an example hazard specification. 
The Hazard property is associated with the error behavior state 
that is the error source. Such hazard specifications are characterized 
with severity and criticality. Other models can be found
on our github public example repository:
<a href="https://github.com/osate/examples">https://github.com/osate/examples</a>.
</p>
<pre>
  device PositionSensor
    features
      PositionReading: out data port ;
    flows
      f1: flow source PositionReading {
        Latency => 2 ms .. 3 ms;
        };
    annex EMV2 {**
        use types ErrorLibrary;
    	use behavior ErrorModelLibrary::Simple;
    	error propagations 
    		PositionReading: out propagation  {ServiceOmission};
    	flows
    	
		 ef1:error source PositionReading {ServiceOmission} when Failed;
	end propagations;
	properties
	-- property is associated with the error behavior state as the source of an error source.
	-- it uses the generic version of the Hazard property
		EMV2::severity => 1 applies to ef1.Failed;
		EMV2::likelihood => C applies to ef1.Failed;
	EMV2::hazard => 
	[	crossreference => "1.1.1";
		failure => "Loss of sensor readings";
		phase => "all";
		description => "No position readings due to sensor failure";
		comment => "Becomes major hazard, if no rdeundant sensor";
			]
			applies to ef1.Failed;
    **};
  end PositionSensor;
</pre>



<h3>Functional Hazard Assessment report example</h3>
<p>
From the previous model, we can automatically generated the report, as shown below.
Catastrophic and critical hazards are shown as included in a 
Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA) report. 
The remaining hazards remain in the model for safety analysis 
activities in later phases.
</p>
<p>
The set of hazards to be reported is determined as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Each component instance in a system instance model that 
has an EMV2 subclause with an error propagations section is 
a candidate. If the section contains error flow specifications, 
then every error source is a candidate. Otherwise, every 
outgoing error propagation is a candidate, 
if the hazard property identifies it as hazard.
</li>
<li>The error source or outgoing error propagation as a 
whole can be identified as hazard. Alternatively, each 
original error source defined for an error propagation 
through the error source declaration can be treated as
 a separate hazard. In this case, the hazard is identified 
 by the error source identifier, the error state identifier 
 and optionally followed by an error type associated with the 
 error state, or by the error source identifier and the error type. 
 In both cases the identified error types must be an error type in the specified type set.
</li>
</ul>
