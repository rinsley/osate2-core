<h2>Error-Model Annex v2 - Fault Impact Analysis</h2>
<p>
The goal of the Fault Impact Analysis is to trace the error
paths between the error source and the impacted component.
Used with the <a href="fha.html">Functional Hazard Assessment</a>,
it is a valuable information for evaluating
the system safety.
</p>

<p>
To use the function, select the system instance file and click

The Fault Impact Analysis then retrieves all components that have 
outgoing error propagations and get all error paths starting
from each of them. Then, it logs all the components
across the error path so that users can check the potential
impacts from a fault occurring in that component.
