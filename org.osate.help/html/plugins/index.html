<H2>OSATE plug-ins</H2>
<p>
OSATE also provide a set of plug-ins, either for validating your models or
interface them with other tools. Users can develop their own 
plug-ins to connect AADL models with other tools. The following sub-sections
present the tools included in the pre-defined set of plugins shipped
with OSATE.

<p>
For fault analysis support see <a href="../emv2/index.html">Error Model V2</a>
</p>
<p>
The following plug-ins are currently included with OSATE:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="MassAnalysis.html">Weight (Mass) Analysis</a></strong>: analyzes
		the weight of components in an instance model.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="latency.html">Flow Latency Analysis</a></strong>: analyzes
		latency of end to end flows in an instance model.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="ElectricalPower.html">Electrical Power Analysis</a></strong>: analyzes
		electrical power budgets against electrical power supply within the capacity of the electrical power transmission system.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="ResourceBudgets.html">Resource Budget Analysis for MIPS, RAM, ROM, and Network Bandwidth</a></strong>: compares 
		resource budgets against capacities, in case of components bound to a resource, only for those budgets bound to a given resource.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="sei.html">Other SEI analysis plug-ins</a></strong>: analyzes 
		models for given quality criteria (security, safety, performance, etc.).
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="imv.html">Instance Model Viewer</a></strong> or IMV: provides
		a graphical view of the Instance Model.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong><a href="functional-importer.html">Simulink importer</a></strong>: 
		provides the ability to generate an AADL skeleton model from a functional
		model that is using Simulink language.
	</li>
</ul>
